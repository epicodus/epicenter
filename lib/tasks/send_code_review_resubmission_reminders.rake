According to our records, you have not yet resubmitted your project from week #{code_review.number} for #{course.description}, which was reviewed and evaluated as failing one or more objectives. We strongly encourage all students to complete resubmissions promptly, so that you do not fall behind, and to give your teacher time to review your work and provide you with valuable feedback.  Please make arrangements to rework your failing project and submit it as soon as possible. If you do not submit work that clearly demonstrates an effort to pass before #{(local_date + 1.day).strftime('%A %B %d')}, you may be withdrawn from class.
